In this project, I built a supervised machine learning model to predict house prices using various features like area, number of rooms, rainfall, etc. I followed a structured approach which included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation.


# House Price Prediction

In this project, I developed a supervised machine learning model to predict house prices based on various input features such as area, number of rooms, rainfall, and other property-related attributes. The goal was to build a reliable model that can estimate the price of a house using historical data.

# Objective

To accurately predict house prices using regression algorithms, based on both numerical and categorical features, and apply real-world data processing and modeling techniques.

# Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data visualization and EDA

Scikit-learn – for model building and evaluation

Imbalanced-learn (imblearn) – for handling imbalanced datasets

# Key Steps Performed

Data Preprocessing 

EDA

Feature Selection

Data Balancing

Model Building and Evaluation
